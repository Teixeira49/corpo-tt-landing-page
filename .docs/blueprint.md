## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#0000FF), derived from the logo's blue squares. The choice evokes corporate trust and stability. Used for key interactive elements and links.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF), for a clean and professional feel. High contrast ensures excellent readability.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFFF00), strategically used for icons on dark backgrounds. This enhances visibility and guides the user’s focus to crucial interface elements.
- Font family: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface known for its clean lines and modern appearance, suitable for both headings and body text, and providing a consistent reading experience. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Maintain generous horizontal and vertical margins (around 5-10% of page dimensions) to ensure a spacious layout. The content will be left-aligned to improve readability and a sense of order.
- Utilize simple, line-based or solid fill icons, primarily in yellow (#FFFF00) when used against dark blue backgrounds. Icons represent key concepts, improving visual communication.
- The sections should have clearly defined blocks to separate content and images. Each section has a padding (20-40px) to allow content to have readable space around.
